# Excel_challenge
Crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter and Indiegogo have been growing in success and popularity since the late 2000s. From independent content creators to famous celebrities, more and more people are using crowdfunding to launch new products and generate buzz, but not every project has found success.

To receive funding, the project must meet or exceed an initial goal, so many organizations dedicate considerable resources looking through old projects in an attempt to discover “the trick” to finding success. In this project, organized and analyzed a database of 1,000 sample projects to uncover any hidden trends.
So that the following methods are used:
* Conditional Formatting
* Column Creation
* Pivot Tables and Stacked Column Charts
* Pivot Tables and Line Graphs
* Crowdfunding Goal Analysis:Computed calculations of percentages for projects that were successful, failed, or were canceled per goal range and Created a line chart showing the relationship between the goal’s     
  amount and its chances at success, failure, or cancellation
* Statistical Analysis :
   Computed calculations of the mean, median, min, max, variance, and stdev using Excel formulas.
  A brief and compelling justification of whether the mean or median better summarizes the data.
